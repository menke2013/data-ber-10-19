# Visualization of Pokemons

For this project i obtained data about pokemons from [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets) .

I transformed the csv finle into an excel file, because Tableau can read those better.

In this data we looked onto the attributes of around 800 Pokemons. They have a main type and sometimes a sub type. This is important because those define strenghts and weaknesses against other types.

They also have stats like attack, defense, hp and more which determine also the result of a fight between them.
